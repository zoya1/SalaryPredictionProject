### Define problem
Organization's fair and well balanced pay structure is one of the top priority for any prospective employee. Good organizations often offer competitive salary and retain well trained employees for years which is more productive than paying less and  keeping  up with high turn over rates of employees who would leave the company for the reason of salary. Salary prediction is an important tool not only for HR department to offer fair salary to potential hires but also to job seekers in making more informed decisions.

In this portfolio project, model was built using provided datasets with 1 million jobpostings (train_features.csv and train_salaries.csv) predicted salaries for 1 million job postings listed in test_features.csv. This analysis does not include deployment process.

### Data Collection
Following were the datasets provided.

* train_features.csv: One million job advertisements. Each row represented metadata for an individual job posting. The job Id column represented a unique identifier for the job posting. The remaining columns described features of the job posting.

* train_salaries.csv: Each row provided corresponding salaries for the jobposting data in train_features.csv.

* test_features.csv: This is similar to train_features.csv, each row represented metadata for an individual job posting.

Testing and training datasets were loaded into pandas dataframes. Both the datasets had identical formats.
